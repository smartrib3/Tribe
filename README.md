# Tribe Smart Contract

This is a simple smart contract for managing tribal membership information on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows members to be added to the tribe and provides a function for retrieving information about a specific member.

## Prerequisites

- An Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask, for deploying and interacting with the contract
- Some Ether in the Ethereum wallet to pay for the gas fees associated with executing the contract on the Ethereum network
- A development environment for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts, such as Remix

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the contract, follow these steps:

1. Open Remix in your browser: Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/ to access the Remix development environment.
2. Copy and paste the code: Copy the code for the smart contract and paste it into the Remix editor.
3. Compile the code: Click on the "Compile" button in the Remix toolbar to compile the code and ensure that there are no syntax errors.
4. Deploy the contract: Click on the "Run" button in the Remix toolbar and select "Injected Web3" as the environment. Then, click the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract to the Ethereum network.

## Interacting with the Contract

Once the contract has been deployed, you can interact with it by calling its functions. The contract provides two functions:

1. "addMember": This function allows members to be added to the tribe by providing their id, name, age, and location.
2. "getMember": This function allows members to retrieve information about a specific member by providing their id.

To call a function, fill out the input fields for the function in the Remix interface and click on the "Submit" button. The results of the function will be displayed in the output section of the Remix interface.
